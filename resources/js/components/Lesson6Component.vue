        <p class="text-center "><b>Subject-Verb Agreement: One of ... (Something)</b></p>
        <p class="mt-3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A verb should agree with its subject in number and person. In general, if the subject is
            singular, the verb referring to the subject should be singular; if the subject is plural, the verb
            referring to the subject should be plural. However, there are a number of situations that call for a
            closer look. Having ‘one of…’ in sentences is what we should look closer at.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sentence begins with ‘One of…’, it is always followed by a singular verb.</p>
        <p class="text-center mt-3"><b>One of + plural noun + singular verb</b></p>
        <p class="text-center mt-3">One of the students in our class <u>is</u> from Japan.</p>
        <p>In the expression ‘One of the students’, the speaker employs "one" to refer to one student out of a
            group of two or more students, so the verb must be singular.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p class="mx-5">One of my friends <u>has</u> been injured in a car accident.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">One of us <u>does</u> not like to wear a necktie.</p>
